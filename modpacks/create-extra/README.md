# Create Extra

Create Extra is a small collection of mostly client-side mods designed to enhance your experience with the [Create Mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/create-fabric) on **Fabric** and **Quilt**. This modpack adds select mods with the objective of providing a better Minecraft world or server experience, without overwhelming you with unnecessary additions.

### ðŸ“¥ Installation

To install and play the modpack with the **.mrpack** file, you will need an extra launcher. Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.modrinth.com/docs/modpacks/playing_modpacks/).

**Server Side**

To install the server-side mods, you can use [mrpack-install](https://github.com/nothub/mrpack-install).

**Resource Pack**

If you want to play with a nice vanilla-themed resource pack, we recommend [VanillaTweaks](https://vanillatweaks.net/).
